## Project Analysis

User Profile

The target audience of this website consists of recruiters, professors, and potential collaborators who want to get a quick and clear overview of my professional profile.
These users expect to find essential information about my education, skills, and experience, along with a few selected projects that demonstrate my abilities. Because they usually have limited time, the website needs to be simple, fast, and intuitive, allowing them to understand who I am in just a few seconds.
The site follows a one-page layout, where all content is clearly structured and accessible through a fixed navigation bar. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
The tone and appearance aim to communicate professionalism, clarity, and personality, presenting me as a reliable and motivated developer. The main goal is that the visitor can quickly get an overall picture of my skills and easily contact me if interested in collaboration or recruitment.

Information Architecture

The website is a single-page portfolio, organized into four main sections:

About Me – A short personal introduction with background and career goals.

Skills – A structured list of technical tools and competencies.

Projects – A small portfolio with concise descriptions and external links.

Contact – Professional contact options and social links.
Navigation is provided by a fixed top menu that remains visible while scrolling, allowing users to jump smoothly between sections.
The information flow follows a logical vertical structure, with balanced spacing and consistent typographic hierarchy to maintain readability.
Each section is designed to stand out visually while maintaining unity across the page, creating a clear and engaging experience that helps users find what they need without distractions.

Visual Design

The visual concept is based on a modern and minimalist style, emphasizing clarity and usability. The color palette combines light neutral tones (white and soft gray) with a blue accent (#0077cc) to highlight interactive elements such as links and buttons. This combination evokes professionalism and calmness.
The typography used is Inter, a clean and readable sans-serif font optimized for digital interfaces. Generous white space is used to organize the layout and create a balanced rhythm that improves content focus.
The layout is implemented using Flexbox, allowing the page to adapt dynamically to any screen size and remain fully responsive. Soft shadows and rounded corners add depth and a subtle visual identity without overcomplicating the interface.
Animations and transitions are smooth and subtle, contributing to a professional look and pleasant navigation experience.
Overall, the design aims to reflect professional balance, readability, and elegance, resulting in a clean personal portfolio that effectively communicates both competence and personality.
